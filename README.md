# Online auction system #

This is my final semester project which I am developing by myself without any partner. 
I chose this topic because E-commerce is very interesting and there are lot of things to learn. Though this system is not fully ecommerce system, I wanted to develop system which can be used by everyone who want to sell their product unlike only merchants can sell in typical ecommerce system. So this is kind of C2C system, anyone can be seller and buyear at any time.
